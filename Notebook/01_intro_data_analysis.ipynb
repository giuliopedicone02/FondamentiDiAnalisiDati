While observations are abstract concepts such as \"a person\" or \"a student\", we **usually want to capture specific features of such observations**, such as \"the person's age\" or \"the student's height\". We collect these features by means of **statistical variables**.\n",

        "## The Data Analysis Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we've seen the main concepts, terminology, and tools involved in working with data, we can introduce a broader perspective: the **data analysis workflow**. This is the structured process that guides how we move from raw data to insights, decisions, and predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s begin with a working definition, adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis):\n",
        "\n",
        "> Data analysis is the **process** of inspecting, **cleaning**, **transforming**, and **modeling** data with the goal of **discovering useful information**, **informing conclusions**, and **supporting decision-making**.\n",
        "\n",
        "While this definition is informal, it provides a useful starting point. In the sections below, we’ll unpack its key components and introduce the main types and goals of data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis as a Process\n",
        "\n",
        "The definition above emphasizes that data analysis is a **process**—not a single algorithm or technique, but a sequence of steps that combine statistical reasoning, domain knowledge, and computational tools. These steps often include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Inspecting**: Assessing the structure and content of the dataset—number of rows and columns, types of variables, typical values, and potential anomalies. For example, in a dataset of student marks, we might expect scores to range from 0 to 10.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Cleaning**: Correcting or removing problematic data entries. This could involve handling missing values, removing duplicates, or filtering out invalid entries (e.g., negative marks or scores above the maximum).\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Transforming**: Modifying the data to make it more suitable for analysis. This might include creating new columns (e.g., a mean score per student), rescaling variables, or converting formats (e.g., dividing English scores out of 30 by 3 to match other subjects scored out of 10).\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Modeling**: Applying statistical or machine learning models to summarize, explain, or predict aspects of the data. A model can help us understand relationships between variables—for instance, predicting English scores based on performance in other subjects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Typical Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "A standard data analysis workflow includes the following stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define** your data analysis question  \n",
        "2. **Collect** the data needed to answer that question  \n",
        "3. **Clean and format** the data  \n",
        "4. **Explore and describe** the data  \n",
        "5. **Choose suitable models** for the analysis  \n",
        "6. **Fit, fine-tune, evaluate, and compare** the models  \n",
        "7. **Review and update** the analysis as new data becomes available\n",
        "\n",
        "### A Non-Linear Process\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the workflow is presented as a sequence, real-world data analysis is rarely linear. Analysts often revisit earlier steps based on what they learn along the way. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- After exploring the data (step 4), you might discover outliers and return to cleaning (step 3)  \n",
        "- You might realize that your initial question (step 1) needs refinement  \n",
        "- You might need additional data (step 2) to improve your model\n",

        "### Example: Analyzing Customer Reviews\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s walk through a practical example. A data analyst at an e-commerce company is tasked with improving product quality and customer satisfaction by analyzing customer reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Step 1**: Define the question: “What are the common themes and issues in customer reviews?”  \n",
        "- **Step 2**: Collect reviews from the company website, social media, and third-party platforms  \n",
        "- **Step 3**: Clean the data—remove duplicates, correct spelling, standardize formatting  \n",
        "- **Step 4**: Explore the data—use word clouds, sentiment analysis, and frequency counts  \n",
        "- **Step 5**: Choose a model—apply topic modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation)  \n",
        "- **Step 6**: Evaluate the model—realize that topics are overlapping and unclear  \n",
        "- **Step 4 (again)**: Re-explore the data—identify that product and service issues are mixed  \n",
        "- **Step 5 (again)**: Separate reviews into categories and reapply topic modeling  \n",
        "- **Step 6**: Obtain clearer topics like “defective products” and “responsive support”  \n",
        "- **Step 7**: Commit to ongoing review as new reviews come in\n",
        "\n",
        "This iterative approach allows the analyst to refine insights and adapt strategies over time.\n",
